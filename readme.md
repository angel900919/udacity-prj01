To test the app please access the following endpoint follow by the image name and width and height:

example:
http://localhost:3000/api/images?filename=fjord&width=500&height=900

The server won’t resize if the image already exists.

To test the endpoints and resizing module with jasmin, start “test” script

Sharp module only test weather a specific image already exist or not
